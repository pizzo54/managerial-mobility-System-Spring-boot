If you are interested in understanding the project's inner workings and enhancing your knowledge, we recommend focusing on the front-end part of the repository. The front-end, developed using Angular, holds valuable insights into the user interface, navigation, and overall user experience. While the backend, powered by Spring Boot with Spring JPA, Spring Security, and Spring MVC, is crucial for data management and security, delving into the front-end will provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's user-centric design and functionality.
